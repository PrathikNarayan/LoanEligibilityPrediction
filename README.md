# LoanEligibilityPrediction
This repo consists of the project " Eligibility For Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms". <br><br>

The purpose of this project is to determine which loan applications are eligible to be sanctioned by using various machine learning algorithms to extract patterns from a dataset of common loan application submissions. In addition, this study comprises feature extraction, data processing, and download of transaction data while taking into account the current circumstances of a bank credit application. <br>

To run the file install Jupyter Notebook and upload both the files(.ipynb and .csv) in the initial dashboard of the jupyter notebook and then open the loan_eligibility_.ipynb notebook and run all the cells. <br><br>
Additional writeup for the project is also included for reference.
